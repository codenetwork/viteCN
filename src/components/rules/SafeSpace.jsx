      <H1>Safe Space Policy</H1>
      <p>
        Code Network is and always will be a safe and inclusive space for everyone. We believe that in the absence of true equality in our
        world, we should aim to provide equity to those who need it.
      </p>
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-xl mb-2 font-bold">Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Abuse, discrimination, harassment, assault, sexism, racism, ableism, religious persecution or homophobic behaviour of any kind is
          not tolerated in the Code Network community. This includes events, discussions and online communications. Any other behavior which
          would reasonably make a person feel trivialised or otherwise discriminated against is also prohibited. If you violate this policy
          you could be asked to leave our community either temporarily or permanently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abuse, discrimination, harassment and anything else mentioned above is not tolerated in this group. Anyone violating this policy
          may be asked to leave our community either temporarily or permanently. Please question in advance your capacity to deal with being
          asked to leave if necessary and how you would react in a progressive way if you were called out for behaviour in violation of this
          policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alcohol and other drugs are not an excuse for bad behaviour. We recognise the difficulties imposed by mental health and/or other
          disabilities, but these issues are not an excuse for poor behaviour either. Everyone can expect to be held accountable of their
          behaviour equally. We ask that you be aware of your capacity to remain in control of your emotions, actions and reactions when
          these things come into play.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you experience or witness any behaviour that crosses the boundaries, ideas or intentions in this policy, challenge them. If you
          act contrary to this policy, expect to be challenged. This means every time someone acts contrary to this policy, pull them up on
          it. Be polite but firm, and explain why their behaviour is not ok.
        </p>

            We all take part in the Code Network community with a commitment to mutual respect, aid, anti-oppression advocacy, conflict
            resolution, non-violence and community building.
          </li>
          <li>
            We respect everyone’s names, preferred gender pronouns, expressed identities and experiences. We avoid making assumptions,
            promote mutual appreciation and understand that no one is required to share information about their identities or experiences.
          </li>
          <li>
            We support the empowerment of each person and strive to continually acknowledge the histories and structures of oppression that
            marginalize some and divide us all.
          </li>
          <li>We commit to making our community as accessible as possible; physically, socially, and personally.</li>
          <li>We do not engage in violence or threats.</li>
          <li>We obtain explicit consent for physical contact or using others’ belongings.</li>
          <li>
            We recognise that certain behaviour and language can act as a trigger for individuals, such as trivialising, joking about or
            dismissing someone’s thoughts or experiences.
          </li>
          <li>
            We believe in stepping back and letting people and groups explain and conceive their own needs and requirements, and respect
            their choices and experiences.
          </li>
          <li>
            We accept a shared responsibility where we hold ourselves and one another accountable to these agreements, without violence,
            judgment, or assumption of intent.
          </li>
          <li>
            We support the concept of freedom of speech, and aim to avoid all forms of censorship. However, we do not support freedom from
            consequence. Your free speech may incur consequences such as (but not limited to) moderation, being included in a dispute
            process, temporary or permanent exclusion from our community, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            We promote inclusive learning spaces. We encourage anyone who is feeling less than familiar with terminology, concepts or
            context to ask questions in the spirit of personal growth and learning.
