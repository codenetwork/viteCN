        <p>
          <i>
            Don’t post anything off topic. Memes etc. are ok in moderation, but avoid them. If you’re a recruiter, your job post doesn’t
            belong in our community. If you’re a technical looking to fill a paid role feel free to advertise it but include detailed info
            about the role. No advertising or self promotion - share stuff you’ve built to start conversations, not conversions. Always
            follow our <Link class="text-primary" href='/rules/conduct'>Code of Conduct</Link> and <Link class="text-primary" href='/rules/safespace'>Safe Space Policy</Link>.

        <h2 class="text-xl mb-2 font-bold">Keep posts etc on topic</h2>
        <p>
          Our FB group is primarily for technical discussions, networking, demoing side-projects, & making friends. Occasional off-topic
          memes are fine, just keep in mind that excessive off-topic discussions our better suited for our community Discord server.
          Off-topic posts may be removed without notice at moderators&rsquo; discretion.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl mb-2 font-bold">Recruiter/non technical looking to fill a role</h2>
        <p>
          If you are not in a technical role (e.g. recruiter, hiring manager, hr employee, etc.) this section applies to you. Your job
          advert doesn’t belong here. If you represent a company, contact your technical (development) team and send them to talk to our
          members. If you don’t work for a tech company, sorry, but we can’t help you. Remember, if you lie or mislead anyone we may exclude
          you from the community for violating our Code of Conduct.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl mb-2 font-bold">Technical person looking to fill a role</h2>
        <p>
          If you are in a technical role (developer, dev ops, etc) or are an academic at an educational institution looking to fill a paid
          role, you don’t need to ask before sharing an opportunity. The best place to post is our Facebook group or discord. Make sure you
          post in the correct channels if posting in Discord. If it is an unpaid role please speak to a member of the executive to get
          approval. This includes all internships and “work experience” opportunities. We do this to prevent our community being taken
          advantage of. Finally, when sharing a position be sure to include relevant info like the language, stack and any experience that
          is required.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl mb-2 font-bold">Advertising/Self Promotion</h2>
        <p>
          We don’t allow blatant advertising, view/lead generation or self promotion in either our Discord* or Facebook group. You can share
          projects, videos or any other technical thing you’ve worked on. However you must aim to seek feedback or help, create a discussion
          or otherwise contribute to the community. Creating a conversation is different to conversion.
          <br />
          <i>*specific discord channels may allow self promotion, links etc. It must explicitly say this in the channel description.</i>
